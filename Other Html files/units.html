        <p><em>Islands</em> are host to diverse plant and animal life. <b>Oceanic islands</b> have the sea as a natural 
            barrier to the introduction of new species, causing the species that do reach the island to evolve
             in isolation.</p>

        <p style="color:crimson; font-size:30px;">Humans have lived on and traveled between islands for thousands of years at a <strong>minimum</strong>. Some islands 
            became host to humans due to a land bridge or a continental island splitting from the mainland.</p>
        <p>Islands became the target of colonization by Europeans, resulting in the majority of islands in the 
            Pacific being put under European control.</p>
