  <p>Animalia (/ˌænɪˈmeɪliə/[4]). With few exceptions, animals consume organic material, breathe oxygen,
   have myocytes and are able to move, can reproduce sexually, and grow from a hollow sphere of cells, t
   he blastula, during embryonic development. Animals form a clade, meaning that they arose from a
    single common ancestor.</p>

<p>Over 1.5 million living animal species have been described, of which around 1.05 million are insects, over 
85,000 are molluscs, and around 65,000 are vertebrates. It has been estimated there are as many as 7.77
 million animal species on Earth. Animal body lengths range from 8.5 μm (0.00033 in) to 33.6 m (110 ft).
  They have complex ecologies and interactions with each other and their environments, forming intricate 
  food webs. The scientific study of animals is known as zoology, and the study of animal behaviour is 
  known as ethology.</p>

<p>Most living animal species belong to the infrakingdom Bilateria, a highly proliferative clade whose members
 have a bilaterally symmetric body plan. The vast majority belong to two large superphyla: the protostomes,
  which includes organisms such as the arthropods, molluscs, flatworms, annelids and nematodes; and the 
  deuterostomes, which include the echinoderms, hemichordates and chordates, the latter of which contains 
  the vertebrates. The simple Xenacoelomorpha have an uncertain position within Bilateria.</p>
